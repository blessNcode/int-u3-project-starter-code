            <h1>You are awoken by a speaker crackling to life. “Prisoner 43125,” says a robotic voice. 
                “You have been brought to Death’s Door for crimes against humanity. 
                You have run rampant through many time periods causing chaos, including blowing up the Pyramids in 239 B.C. 
                and giving a cell phone to DaVinci and having him take a selfie with Mona Lisa. 
                This prison is connected to every place in time and holds history's and the future’s most notorious criminals so don’t try to escape. 
                If you are hoping that death will grant you a reprieve, you are sadly mistaken." The voice lets out a chuckle and goes silent. What now?</h1>

             That is because the creator of this website said so. There is a light and whispering voices down the left path, while the right is shrouded in a darkness 
             that seems to have no end. What direction will you go?</h1>

            <h1>You crawl toward the light and look down. You see three men, sitting around a table wearing what looks like purple bed sheets.
                 One of the men looks up and yells, “Ahh, Graecus exploratorem”. You pause for a second and try to remember any of the material you learned in your high school Latin class. 
                 A speaker crackles to life. "It means Greek Spy, you doofus". As you come to this realization, the last thing you see is a sword swinging straight for your head.</h1>

            <h1>You fumble around in the dark and suddenly drop down. As you fall, the dark scenery changes to a bright forest. You land heavily on your back, in a patch of flowers. There's a rainbow in the sky and birds tweeting in the distance. You close your eyes and take a second to gather yourself. Suddenly, you hear loud booming sounds like something big is walking in your direction. You open your eyes to find the maws of a gigantic T-rex right above you. The last thing you sees are massive teeth closing over your head. </h1>

                 You step out onto a busy street in London. The girl walks in after you. "You see that tall tower? It holds the crown jewels and your're going to help me steal them."

“Prisoner 43125,” said a voice. “It would seem that the prison is getting a bit full. Guards are being sent over to prepare you for your execution. Goodbye.”
